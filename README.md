# Camel Up
A recreation of board game Camel Up (originally published by Pegasus Spiele, https://goo.gl/4gCSxA) using C# and Unity 2017. This project is currently underdevelopment. 

Progress Update #1

The movement mechanics of the game have been sucessfully implemented, this includes a rolling 5 coloured dice independently and moving the coloured "camel" around the course, if a camel lands on the same square as another it stacks on top. When a camel moves it takes with it all camels above it.
